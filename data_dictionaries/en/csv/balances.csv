> ðŸš§ Warning
>
> The `last_updated_at` parameter depends on how the institution processes (or stores) data. In the case that the institution stores data synchronously (that is, as soon as a transaction occurs, the balance us updated), then the `last_updated_at` will reflect the balance in near real time. In the case that the institution stores data asynchronously (that is, it retrieves data in bulk and then updates the balance), the balance information can refer to hours or days ago. Additionally, in the case that the institution cannot provide the specific time (due to an internal error), the institution may provide an overall time where they last refreshed the account and balance information.
